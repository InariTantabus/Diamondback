This was originally just me trying to remake the original snake game. Then I kept adding to it.
Now it can be played in two modes, classic and endless.

Classic plays as the original snake with a few changes. Your snake gets less visible the longer it is, and staying close to the edge of the stage decreases the playing area.

Endless plays the same as classic but with a highly expanded play area. (Used to be endless, but was limited when I started working on creating a more defined gameloop.)
